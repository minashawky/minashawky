### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for visiting my hub!

I'm someone who's been working in the "Software" industry for quiet some time, and I should easily say that I enjoy nothing more in my career than learning and writing code. There's just something very special about the challenges of writing a sequence of instructions - in the cleanest and most efficient way - to get things done. The sense of achievement you get from solving bugs, or making things work, is priceless.

If you check my LinkedIn you'll see I've done it all. I was a Backend Developer, did some Front end, did some Systems Integration Development, did project management, did customer success and did C-suite operations management, but I can again say there was nothing better than writting code.

My Hub is new! My Public Repos are mainly learning material and stuff that I'll keep adding while I learn.
